# Starbucks-new-stores-allocation-problem
The choice of retail store locations is one of the most important decisions a retailer has to make. 
Starbucks shows a great example of how chain retailers utilize big data in optimizing store locations. 
Through analysis of consumer demographic, population density, income levels, auto traffic patterns, 
public transport stops, Starbucks is able to find potential spots and evaluate the economic viability 
of opening new stores in the potential spots. In this project, I seek to provide a simpler version of 
the Starbucks optimization model for locating new stores.
